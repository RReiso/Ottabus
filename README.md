## Description

With constantly increasing gas prices more and more people rely on local public transportation daily. I live in Ottawa and use OC transpo services often. This app helps fellow commuters learn what buses are coming to a particular stop and in how many minutes they will arrive. The app also shows the current location of a selected bus on an integrated Google map, as well as the current weather in Ottawa. To build this app I used OC Transpo API, Google Maps API and Open Weather API. This app is my first attempt using TypeScript and MaterialUI. I keep learning React Testing Library and used it to write tests for Ottabus.

## Key Features

- Enter stop number
- See upcoming trips
- See in how many minutes the buses are arriving
- See the location of a selected bus on a map
- See the current weather in Ottawa
