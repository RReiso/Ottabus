## Description

With constantly increasing gas prices more and more people rely on local public transportation services daily. I live in Ottawa and use OC transpo services often. This app helps fellow comuters learn what buses are coming to a particular stop and in how many minutes they will arrive allowing the comuters to prepare for their rides. It also shows the current location of the bus on an integrated map. I used OC transpo API, Google maps API and Open Weather API to build this app dedicated to the city I call my home, Ottawa.

## Key Features

- Enter stop number
- See upcoming trips
- See in how many minutes the buses are arriving
- See the location of a selected bus on a map
- See the current weather in Ottawa
